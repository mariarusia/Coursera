The script run_analysis.R takes the subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt, features.txt, activity_labels.txt and creates a course_project.txt with a data set with the average of each mean and std varibles for each subject and activity

You shoud save the subject_test.txt, X_test.txt, y_test.txt, subject_train.txt, X_train.txt, y_train.txt, features.txt, activity_labels.txt to the same directory as the run_analysis.R or change the paths to these files in the script
